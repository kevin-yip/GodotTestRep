This is the full source code with all the system produced for the [Make Professional 2d Games with Godot](https://gumroad.com/l/godot-tutorial-make-professional-2d-games) course.

This game demo tries to show good Godot programming practices to support a growing game project. It has multiple interlocking systems, the core gameplay loop in place, a boss encounter, an inventory and shop systems, user interface with nested menus...

## LICENSE ##

The entire source code is available under the MIT licence and everyone is welcome to [contribute](https://github.com/GDquest/make-pro-2d-games-with-godot/issues/)! Better art, gameplay improvements, code re-factoring, and moreâ€¦

All the techniques I used to build this project are in our [intermediate-level Godot course on Gumroad](https://gumroad.com/gdquest). If you're interested in getting it, be aware it's not 100% step-by-step.

If you have requests for tutorials from elements of that game demo, please feel free to [ask on Twitter](https://twitter.com/NathanGDquest)! I will not redo what's in the course but I'll gladly make extra videos that would benefit everyone! ðŸ˜„

This is our first open game on GDQuest. We are looking to build more Free games and game creation tools in the future. Be sure to [subscribe to our YouTube channel](http://youtube.com/c/gdquest) to know when that happens â˜º

## Dependencies ##

The project runs in **Godot 3.1**.

### User interface ###

- Animated boss light bar that appears when the boss spans

### Visual effects ###

- Layered particle systems like explosions, bursting fire, rock sparkles, dust
