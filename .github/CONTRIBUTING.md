Thank you very much for helping us make the project better! ðŸ˜„
We appreciate every contribution, and you taking the time to give back to the community. ðŸ™‚
At the same time, there are a few guidelines we'd ask you to follow here to help bring everyone's work together as smoothly as possible.

This guide explains how to report bugs, but how to suggest new features, where you can get support with the project as a user, and how to get in touch with other creators through the community channels.

## How Do I Submit A (Good) Bug Report?

We track both bugs and improvements in the issues tab on GitHub.

Writing a good bug report makes it a lot easier for maintainers and contributors to fix it. A good bug report:

1. Starts with a clear title that describes the issue
1. Includes a list of steps to reproduce the bug, an information about the version of the program and the platform you're working with
1. Contains the traceback or the error reported by the program in the output tab when the bug occurs

You should also mention any steps you've taken to try and solve the issue or extra information you think would be valuable to help track down and fixed a bug.

*Tips: take a quick screenshot and drag and drop it in the GitHub issue's body to help illustrate the problem! For Windows users, I recommend to use [ShareX](https://getsharex.com/) for that (open source). Ubuntu comes with a built-in tool, press <kbd>Shift</kbd> <kbd>PrtScn</kbd> by default to capture a rectangular area on your screen.*

### Bad and good bug report examples

Here's an example of a *bad* bug report:

```md
# X doesn't work

I can't make feature X work
```

This report doesn't give any information about what the bug is, what triggers it, whether it can be reproduced, if it's platform-specific, if you' re using an unsupported platform...

Here's an example of a good bug report,

```md

```

## I want to submit a new feature or improve existing code

That's great to hear! Be sure to let everyone know you're working on this by opening an issue or replying to an existing issue.

## I need help to use this project!
